      <description>Skip to the goods.
About time I dusted off the cobwebs on this ol blog.
I’m working hard to complete revisions on my first chapter. In preperation, I’ve made a vignette to walk through how to use my R package perfomr, which provides the core modeling and functions that the manuscript relies on. It comes with a way to simulate data, so give it a whirl.
I’ve been trying to learn more about neural networks, so maybe I’ll try to make a post about that (or anything really) soon … ish.</description>

      <description>If you live in a wealthy, liberal town like Boulder, CO, you’ve likely seen your fair share of Toyota Prii (this is supposedly the plural of Prius). Heck, you might even own one. I decided to collect a little data. I used my iPhone stopwatch to record wait times between seeing Prii. I walked at a near-constant speed, along a more or less linear transect along 13th Street, from Arapahoe to Spruce.</description>
