      <h1><a href="/Prius/">What can we learn from spotting a Prius or two?</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>If you live in a wealthy, liberal town like Boulder, CO, you’ve likely seen your fair share of Toyota Prii (this is supposedly the plural of Prius). Heck, you might even own one. I decided to collect a little data. I used my iPhone stopwatch to record wait times between seeing Prii. I walked at a near-constant speed, along a more or less linear transect along 13th Street, from Arapahoe to Spruce. I recorded for 10 minutes, hitting the “lap” button each time I saw a Prius (any year, parked or driving). There is some risk of counting one vehicle multiple times, but because I walked in one direction and only recorded for 10 minutes, I assume the risk is relatively low (unless Prius owners love driving so much, they just go out and do laps around city blocks – quite possible).</p>

        <p>Learning data analysis in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> seems to be an important skill. Speed and 
scalability are the obvious reasons. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> has a reputation for being the 
Machine Learning go-to language, despite the fact that (as far as I can tell) 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/lcashjn">some of the real giants in the field</a> 
create packages and run 
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ht9gj5c">their analysis in <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code></a> (awesome mooc, btw). Despite
my deep and passionate love for <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code>, I’m all about programming bandwagons, 
and I’ve learned some <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> already, so what the heck.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The most excellent Hadley Wickham has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNqlOjhPCQ">great presentation</a> about functional 
programming where he compares the redundancies in cupcake recipes to the 
construction of for loops. The goal of the presentation is to promote his
new package <code class="highlighter-rouge">purrr</code>, which provides a more comprehensive set of functional
programming tools for <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code>, and to show audience members the ease and power of a
functional programming approach. I found the analogy and overall point very 
persuasive, so much so, I changed my twitter bio to include the phrase, 
“recovering for loop addict”. I’m no stranger to using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code> family, but I
never considered it my go-to approach, especially if the task was complex. But
the cupcakes put me over the edge, and I decided to take the plunge as much as 
I could.</p>

        <p>I’ve made some realizations since posting that last one, but many personal mysteries persist. Time to hit the books. I apologize for the layout of text and figures on this post. It’s a little hard to track and differentiate between paragraphs and captions. Have fun.

      <div class="entry">
        <p>July and August have been rather busy months for me. On July 14th, my wife and I had a baby. His name is Felix. He’s awesome. In the science world, I’ve been revising two papers I’m a co-author on, both to do with drought adaptation in <em>Brassia rapa</em> populations in California. I’m glad I’ve finally gotten around to writing another blog post. This one is about additive alleles. I learned a lot writing this post. I hope others get something out of it too. If nothing else, how NOT to do something. <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/silastittes/silastittes.github.io/raw/master/myPDFs/AdditiveAlleles_1.pdf">Enjoy!</a></p>

        <p>I have been working on a second blog post for a while. It concerns a simple simulation of a quantitative trait controlled by many independent additive alleles. It’s really cool! I fear I’m taking too long to write it (“seriously though, does this guy even do research?”), so I wanted to write a different and much more brief posting.

        <p>Wow. Getting started with jekyll takes some front work, but I’m pretty excited to start this adventure into blogging like a hacker. Huge thanks to Barry Clark (and friends?) for making the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll-now</a> git hub repository! I would still be stuck at square one without that repo.</p>
