      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Silas Tittes, a PhD student at CU Boulder studying with Nancy Emery and Nolan Kane. My research focuses on the development and application of methods to learn about adaptive evolution on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Please see my GitHub and Google Scholar pages to learn more. I hope this blog is useful and entertaining to others &amp;ndash; I see it as a space to explore ideas and describe the state of my knowledge/thinking about a given topic at the time of writing.</description>

      <description>If you live in a wealthy, liberal town like Boulder, CO, youâ€™ve likely seen your fair share of Toyota Prii (this is supposedly the plural of Prius). Heck, you might even own one. I decided to collect a little data. I used my iPhone stopwatch to record wait times between seeing Prii. I walked at a near-constant speed, along a more or less linear transect along 13th Street, from Arapahoe to Spruce.</description>
