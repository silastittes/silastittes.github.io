title: Additive alleles and drift Part I, or how to be a bad TA.
---

July and August have been rather busy months for me. On July 14th, my wife and I had a baby. His name is Felix. He's awesome. In the science world, I've been revising two papers I'm a co-author on, both to do with drought adaptation in *Brassia rapa* populations in California. I'm glad I've finally gotten around to writing another blog post. This one is about additive alleles. I learned a lot writing this post. I hope others get something out of it too. If nothing else, how NOT to do something. [Enjoy!](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/silastittes/silastittes.github.io/raw/master/myPDFs/AdditiveAlleles_1.pdf)
