title: Don't hyde from jekyll.
---

Wow. Getting started with jekyll takes some front work, but I'm pretty excited to start this adventure into blogging like a hacker. Huge thanks to Barry Clark (and friends?) for making the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) git hub repository! I would still be stuck at square one without that repo.
