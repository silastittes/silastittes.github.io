title: Another one of those blog posts about apply
---

Here are some recent thoughts I've had about using the apply functions in R. I imagine my target audience for this post as being pretty small. Many readers will already be better than me at using these functions, and some will not have enough experience using them for this post to be useful. As always, I got something out of writing it, so I guess that's something. 

Hard to believe it's been more than a year since I've made a post. I plan on writing some more biology posts soon so stay tuned.
