<p>Wow. Getting started with jekyll takes some front work, but Iâ€™m pretty excited to start this adventure into blogging like a hacker. Huge thanks to Barry Clark (and friends?) for making the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll-now</a> git hub repository! I would still be stuck at square one without that repo.</p>
